        <h1>Digital Humanities Blogs as Infrastructure for Scholarly Communication</h1>

<p>Scholarly communication is in the midst of a dramatic reconfiguration. Scholarly publishing is in crisis <a href="#cite-unsworth-2003">(Unsworth 2003)</a>. The scholarly monograph, the canonical unity of scholarship in the humanities, is in peril <a href="#cite-greenblatt-2002">(Goldblatt 2002)</a>. New forms of digital scholarship <a href="#cite-borgman-2007">(Borgman 2007)</a> challenge existing teaching, research, and publishing practices in the humanities. The Web has opened a new discursive space for scholars, but how this space changes scholarly communication is not well understood. As scholars turned to social media like blogs and Twitter, as an important means of interaction, they leave visible traces behind. Novel approaches to measuring scholarly impact, such as altmetrics <a href="#cite-priem-2010">(Priem et al. 2010)</a>, leverage the high granularity of these traces to better understand the craft of scholarship. In and through these new <i>discursive infrastructure</i> scholarly communities are changing not only their means of knowledge production, but how their identity is constituted as well.</p>

<p> Scholars in the digital humanities have enthusiastically embraced blogs as a discursive infrastructure for interaction. The importance is evident in initiatives such as <a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/">Digital Humanities Now</a> and the <a href="journalofdigitalhumanities.org">Journal of Digital Humanities</a>.These projects aggregate DH blogs by providing filter and editoral review for the DH community. Their editors find high quality discourse from within a curated “compendium” of scholarly blogs and across Twitter. The best selections get collected into the formal, peer-reviewed Journal of Digital Humanities.</p>

 <ul> 
  <li>What are digital humanities scholars talking about on their blogs?</li>
  <li>How do blogs, as infrastructure, support digital humanities discursive practice?</li>
  <li>How can we better understand digital humanities blogs as infrastructure for scholarly communication?
</ul>

<p>Clearly, within the mutually constitutive relationship between digital humanities scholars and the web there emerges interesting and not-well-understood configurations of knowledge practice. My research investigates these practices from the perspective of sociotechnical infrastructure for scholarly communication. How are the digital humanities using blogs? What kinds of discursive practices occur in these spaces? How can we understand this phenomena through the lens of infrastructure <a href="#cite-star-1999">(Star 1999)</a>? My work makes contributions to our ability to understand critical sociotechnical systems by studying digital humanities blogs and through innovations in methodological inquiry. I am taking advantage of new techniques in text mining and machine learning to discover and explore themes within my corpus of digital humanities blogs. Topic modeling algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation <a href="#cite-blei-2003">(Blei 2003)</a> provide a means for distantly reading <a href="#cite-moretti-2005">(Moretti 2005)</a>  texts. However, the models produced by such algorithms still require theoretically grounded methods to understand and interpret. My research method combines topic modeling with Grounded Theory <a href="#cite-glaser-1967">(Glaser & Strauss 1967)</a> as a means for investigating large-scale, distributed sociotechnical infrastructure. LDA provides a means of clustering individual blog posts by mixtures of “topics” or co-occurrences of words. I then analyze the thematic clusters generated by the model through information visualization and qualitative coding and memoing.</p>

<h3>The project has three phases:</h3>
<p>Phase 0 - Data Collection: I will be archiving all of the blogs listed in the DHNow Compendium of the digital humanities, a curated listing of over 500 academic blogs. Leveraging techniques from Machine Learning I will extract text and other interesting features from individual blogs posts. This phase will produce a dataset for other researchers interested in studying scholarly communication.</p>

<p>Phase 1 - Data Analysis: Using the extracted text, I will generate a topic model to facilitate the exploration of a corpus too large for traditional close reading and qualitative analysis. The topic model identifies patterns of discourse within the corpus, distinguishing clusters of co-occurring words and their distribution within individual documents. This model, in conjunction with the original texts, will be visualized as an interactive data visualization for navigating the entire corpus. This phase will produce a web application and database to support the qualitative analysis in the next phase of the project.</p>

<p>Phase 2 - Data Interpretation: The topic models and visualizations alone do not provide an interpretation of, or ascribe meaning to, data they represent. Through qualitative analysis methodology known as Grounded Theory I contextualize the topic model, visualizations, and original texts. This phase takes advantage of the computationally generated topics and visual models to discover specific regions of the corpus for qualitative coding and interpretation. This phase will produce, in the spirit open access, an ongoing blog about my data, my process, and my findings.</p>
