        <h1>Digital Humanities Blogs as Infrastructure for Scholarly Communication</h1>

<p>Scholarly communication in the humanities, and the academy writ large, is in the midst of a dramatic reconfiguration. Publishing is in crisis <a href="#cite-unsworth-2003">(Unsworth 2003)</a>. The monograph, a canonical unit of scholarship in the humanities, is in peril <a href="#cite-greenblatt-2002">(Goldblatt 2002)</a>. Existing teaching, research, and publishing practices must confront new forms of digital scholarship <a href="#cite-borgman-2007">(Borgman 2007)</a>. The Web has opened a new discursive space for scholars, but how this space changes scholarly communication is not well understood. The "invisible college" <a href="#cite-lievrouw-1990">(Lievrouw 1990)</a> is now longer a useful model of scholarly communication as academics turn to social media, like blogs and Twitter, and leave <i>visible</i> traces behind. Novel approaches to measuring scholarly impact, such as altmetrics <a href="#cite-priem-2010">(Priem et al. 2010)</a>, leverage the granularity of these traces to better understand the craft of scholarship. In and through these sociotechnical <i>discursive infrastructure</i> scholarly communities are changing not only their means of knowledge production, but the constitution of their identity as well.</p>

<p>Scholars in the digital humanities have enthusiastically embraced blogs as a discursive infrastructure for epistemic interaction. The importance is evident in initiatives such as <a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/">Digital Humanities Now</a> and the <a href="journalofdigitalhumanities.org">Journal of Digital Humanities</a>.These projects aggregate the flood of DH blogs, providing filter and editorial functions identifying important and informative posts for the DH community. Their editors find high quality discourse from within a curated "compendium" of blogs and across social media. The best selections are collected into the formal, peer-reviewed Journal of Digital Humanities. DHNow and the Journal of Digital Humanities are interesting examples of a new kind of publish-first <i>then</i> peer-review forms of web-centric scholarship.</p>

<h3>Research Questions:</h3>
 <ul> 
  <li>What are digital humanities scholars talking about on their blogs? How do these discussions challenge our current understandings of informal scholarly communication as merely a means towards formal publication? What other roles do blogs serve?</li>
  <li>How do blogs, as infrastructure, support digital humanities discursive practice? How do the technical features of blogs, i.e. rapid publishing and feedback, affect the structure of scholarly communication?</li>
  <li>How can we better understand blogs more generally as an infrastructure for scholarly communication? How do blogs inform a <i>visible</i> invisible college model of scholarly communication?
</ul>

<h3>Methods of Inquiry</h3>
<p>Clearly, within the mutually constitutive relationship between digital humanities scholars and the web emerges interesting and not-well-understood configurations of knowledge practice. My research investigates these practices from the perspective of infrastructure for scholarly communication. How can we understand this phenomena through the lens of infrastructure <a href="#cite-star-1999">(Star 1999)</a>? My work makes contributions to the study of infrastructure by studying blogs as an infrastructural phenomena and through methodological innovations in analyzing large scale digital structures. I am taking advantage of new techniques in text mining and machine learning to discover and explore themes within my corpus of digital humanities blogs. Topic modeling algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation <a href="#cite-blei-2003">(Blei 2003)</a> provide a means for distantly reading <a href="#cite-moretti-2005">(Moretti 2005)</a> texts and extracting clusters of co-occurring words. However, the models produced by such algorithms still require theoretically grounded methods for interpretation. My research method combines topic modeling with Grounded Theory <a href="#cite-glaser-1967">(Glaser & Strauss 1967)</a> as a means for investigating large-scale, distributed sociotechnical infrastructure. LDA provides a means of clustering individual posts by mixtures of “topics,” which I then analyze through information visualization and qualitative coding.</p>

<h3>The project has three phases:</h3>
<p><b>Phase 0 - Data Collection:</b> I will be archiving all of the blogs listed in the DHNow Compendium of the digital humanities, a curated listing of over 500 academic blogs. Leveraging techniques from Machine Learning I will extract text and other interesting features from individual blogs posts. This phase will produce a dataset for myself and other researchers interested in studying scholarly communication.</p>

<p><b>Phase 1 - Data Analysis:</b> Using the extracted text, I will generate a topic model to facilitate the exploration of a corpus too large for traditional close reading and qualitative analysis. The topic model identifies patterns of discourse within the corpus, distinguishing clusters of co-occurring words and their distribution within individual documents. This model, in conjunction with the original texts, will be represented as an interactive data visualization for navigating the entire corpus. This phase will produce a web application and database to support the qualitative analysis in the next phase of the project.</p>

<p><b>Phase 2 - Data Interpretation:</b> The topic models and visualizations alone do not provide an interpretation of, or ascribe meaning to, data they represent. Through a qualitative methodology known as Grounded Theory I contextualize the topic model, visualizations, and original texts. This phase takes advantage of the computationally generated topics and visual models to discover specific regions of the corpus for qualitative coding and interpretation. This phase will produce, in the spirit open access, an ongoing blog discussing my data, my process, and my findings.</p>

<p>This project makes contributions to the digital humanities through a reflexive engagement with their discursive practices, to scholarly communication through a deep examination of academic blogs, and to STS through by introducing innovative, mixed-methodological approaches to studying infrastructure.</p>
